# molecular-plus : Particle Solver for Blender 2.8 - 4.0+

Originally based on molecular addon from pyroevil. https://github.com/Pyroevil/Blender-Molecular-Script
and the efforts of PavelBlend and Scorpion81 for maintaining compatibility with Blender 2.8+. https://github.com/scorpion81/Blender-Molecular-Script



This is my extended version of the addon adding a create panel to be able to fast setup a scene.

I cleaned up the code and moved the molecular+ panel to the physics section of blender, where it belongs.

Added an N-panel to get fast access to setup / simulation.
